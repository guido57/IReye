### Prepare your Raspberry
0. I used a [Raspberry PI 3 Model B Scheda madre CPU 1.2 GHz Quad Core, 1 GB RAM](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B01CD5VC92/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) bought at Amazon
1. Start from a clean sd: I tested 8M and 32M SD Samsung cards.
2. Install "Raspbian Stretch with Desktop" Raspbian Buster with Desktop" , I tested:
   - Buster "2019-06-20-raspbian-buster-full.img" downloaded and with "installation guide" at [Download Raspbian Stretch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
   - Stretch "2017-11-29-raspbian-stretch.img"

3. (Optional, if you don't have screen, keyboard and mouse) Prepare the SD you just created for headless operations following these instructions. [
